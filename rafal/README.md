### Usage

Run `npm install` to install all dependancies.

Run `npm start` to start a local server.

Now you can visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to view your server

### Tests

To run tests use following command `npm test`

### Known issues

When running npm start make sure to access [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) instead of http://127.0.0.1:8080 [http://127.0.0.1:8080 ](http://127.0.0.1:8080). The second one may not load javascript and css correctly.
